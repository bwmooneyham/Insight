# Insight

This folder contains two jupyter notebooks used in the early development and validation of WalkEasy, my web application that provides users with the easiest walking route between locations in San Francsico.

The Web Application itself, and the final scripts and files used in its operation, are contained within a separate repo titled "WalkEasy."
